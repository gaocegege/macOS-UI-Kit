This is a small UI Kit for macOS Sierra.  
This UI Kit is designed at 1x scale, but with retina displays in mind! So if you open this on a non-retina screen it may looks a little blurry. I think we're missing some good retina UI Kits for Mac, so I've created this based on Apple's fine retina display style. 

The Sketch document uses the latest features like Text Styles, Symbols and Auto Layout. **You can [download](https://github.com/alexkaessner/macOS-UI-Kit/archive/master.zip) this Kit for FREE and use it to create your own retina ready designs!**  
Show some love if you like this UI kit and share it with your friends. :+1:

PS any feedback is appreciated! Just take a look at the issues, or [leave me a comment on dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2987000-macOS-Sierra-UI-Kit-for-Sketch) or [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/macos-ui-kit-for-sketch).
